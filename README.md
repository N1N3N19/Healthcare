# Healthcaree
 
First you need to have 2 database localhost 
# 1. MySQL localhost
  I suggest you use MAMP to and set it default to port 3306 and import the hospital(1).sql by use DATABASE name Hospital to MAMP
# 2. GraphDatabase localhost
  I use Neo4j to be my GDB so you need to create the database name Hospital then open the database and copy the query from HealthcareGDB.txt


Next download these project and open the folder with Visual studio code 
we need 2 terminal to runserver of front and back
- to run back type this in a terminal: 
	- cd Backend
 	- npm run dev 
> Make sure that both of your localhost has start the server before run back

- to run front type this in another terminal:
  - cd Frontend
  - npm start
